# Notes on learning in blender

## UI and basics

Blender's screen is divided into parts called editors\
**3D viewport editor:**

- On screen tools are called gizmos on the right side
- On the left side toolbar is situated. Used for transforming objects.

**Navigation:**

- Zoom
  - Mouse wheel scroll
- Orbitting
  - Middle mouse button press and then orbit
- Panning
  - Panning means moving the camera right, left, up, down{using a hand in ebooks does the same}
  - shift+middle_mouse_button
- Views
  - Use cartesian gizmo on top right of 3d viewport editor.
  - Otherwise need extended keyboard to do so.
  - 5 in extended keyboard will toggle between perspective view and orthogonal view.
- Selection
  - Left click with mouse on the object
  
**Shortcuts:**

- `G` for grabbing the object for movements {orthographic recommended}
  - After pressing `G`, if `X` is pressed, the movement will be limited to Z axis. {same for Y, Z}
  - After that, if any number N is pressed, it will move N units in that axis.
- `R` for rotating the object {orthographics recommended}
  - After pressing `R`, if `Z` is pressed, the rotation will be around Z axis
  - After that, if any number N is pressed, it will rotate N degrees anti-clockwise around that axis.
- `S` for scaling the object {orthographic view recommended}
  - After pressing `S`, if `Y` is pressed, the scaling will be only in Y axis.
  - After that, any Number N is pressed, it will scale N units in that axis.
- `Shift+S` Opens the snap menu.
  - Helps to fix the World origin.
  
**Adding objects:**

- `delete` key after selecting an object deletes it.
- Meshes are solid 3D objects
- `A` Selects all the objects in the scene
- `Alt+A` deselects all the objects in the scene
