# Notes on learning from the book: Hacking, The art of exploitation

## Used Command line tools

### ```gcc```

```bash
gcc file.c      # Compiles and assembles file.c and puts the executable into a.out
gcc -m32 file.c # Compiles and assembles file.c for 32bit architectures
```

### ```objdump```

```bash
# objdump - display information from object files.

objdump -D executable   
                        # [-D --disassemble-all]
objdump -D executable -M intel 
                        # [-M options|--disassembler-options=options] is used to disassemble in intel style
```

### ```gdb```

Any (gdb) commands could be stored inside .gdbinit to execute those everytime gdb starts up.

```bash
gdb -q executable       # -q for quiet. Does not print introductory copyright messages
(gdb) set dis intel	# sets disassembly language type to intel
(gdb) break label       # make a breakpoint at the specified label
(gdb) run               # starts running the program till the breakpoint
(gdb) info registers    # Shows the condition of the registers
(gdb) quit              # Quits the gdb session
```
