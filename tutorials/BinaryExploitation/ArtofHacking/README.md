# Notes on learning from the book: Hacking, The art of exploitation

## Used Command line tools

### ```gcc```

```bash
gcc file.c      # Compiles and assembles file.c and puts the executable into a.out
gcc -m32 file.c # Compiles and assembles file.c for 32bit architectures
```

### ```objdump```

```bash
# objdump - display information from object files.

objdump -D executable   
                        # [-D --disassemble-all]
objdump -D executable -M intel 
                        # [-M options|--disassembler-options=options] is used to disassemble in intel style
```

### ```gdb```

Any (gdb) commands could be stored inside .gdbinit to execute those everytime gdb starts up.\
```gdb -q executable``` -q for quiet. Does not print introductory copyright messages\
Inside gdb, gdb commands are written like this: **```(gdb) COMMAND```**\
**COMMANDS:**

* ```set disassembly-flavor intel``` sets disassembly language type to intel
* ```disassemble <label> / disass <label>``` Disassembles the code of specified label
* ```list``` Shows the source code if compiled correctly
* ```break <label>``` make a breakpoint at the specified label
* ```run``` starts running the program till the breakpoint. Restarts the program if used more than once in one execution cycle
* ```continue / cont``` continue the execution till the next breakpoint
* ```info registers``` Shows the condition of the registers. {short form i r}
* ```info register <registerName>``` Shows the condition of the specified register{short form i r registername}
* ```x/nx <memoryaddress>```
  * ```(gdb) x/nx $register``` Examine the memory in hex format. The n refers to how many memory units to show. an unit of memory is 4 bytes or WORD
  * ```x/no <address>``` Examine the memory in octal format
  * ```x/nu <address>``` Examine the memory in unsigned base-10 format
  * ```x/nt <address>``` Examine the memory in binary format
  * ```x/nc <address>``` Examine the memory in unsigned base-10 format with ascii value on
  * ```x/s <address>``` shows the string representation in the memory address
  * ```x/ni $<register>/<address>``` show the instructions at the position the register is pointing to

* ```print $<register>``` Print the data from the memory location the register is pointing to and the result is stored in a temp var
* ```nexti``` Execute next instruction
* ```bt``` For backtracking by looking at stack for return address
* ```quit```              # Quits the gdb session
