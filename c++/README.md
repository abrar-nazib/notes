# C++ Programming Basics

## Memory

Memory is devided into three sections:
|       |
| ----- |
| Heap  |
| Stack |
| Code  |

## Arrays

Collection of similar data elements

```c++
int a[size]; //If declared this way, the array will be created in the stack segment of the memory
int arrayName[size] = {el1, el2, el3, elN}; //Declaration and initialization syntax of an array
```

## Structures

Collection of data members that are related and is under one name. Data members could be of similar type or dissimilar type.\
Usually defined as collection of dissimilar data members under one name. It means grouping of the data items\

```c++
struct Rectangle{
    int length, breadth;
};                              //Definition syntax of a struct

int main(){
    
}
```
