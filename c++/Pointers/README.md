# All About Pointers

## After Basics

```c++
int *pointer;
int* pointer; //same thing

int *pointer = &variable_to_track;
```

## Pointer Arithmatics

Supports basic addition and substruction```*(p + n) -> n = type_dependent_size* n```

## Void Pointers

```c++
void *pointer; // can not de reference
               // can not even perform pointer arithmatics
```
